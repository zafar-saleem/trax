Your task is to create a video playing web application.  The included file screen-rendering.jpg illustrates roughly how the page should look. You are free to express your creativity by applying a nice design to the page.

The included JSON data (movies.json) must be used as the source data for the page content.  Write the application as you would if the data were being fetched from a remote REST API.

Please complete and return this to us in 3 days.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
